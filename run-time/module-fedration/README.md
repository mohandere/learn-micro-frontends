## Get started


[What is module fedration](https://module-federation.github.io/blog/get-started)


## Generate the host and remote applications

```
# npm i -g nx
# React nx g @nx/react:host host --remotes=shop,cart,about # Angular nx g @nx/angular:host host --remotes=shop,cart,about
```

You can leave off the --remotes option and add them later with nx g @nx/react:remote shop --host=host or nx g @nx/angular:remote shop --host=host.


## Serving host, remotes

Now, serve host to view it in your browser.
```
nx serve host --open 
```

To run one or more remotes in development mode, use the --devRemotes option.
```
nx serve host --open --devRemotes="shop,cart" 
```

It will start dev server at http://localhost:4200


Happy coding!
